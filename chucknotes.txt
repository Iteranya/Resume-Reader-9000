to-do:
1. Ask Pandu-sama wth is get_all_records(), it is not in gspread documentation
2. Why is eval_func in main pipeline?
3. Yknow what? langchain is probably good. Structured response for question generation will be great (damn I'm pampered by gemini api). Why? Cuz we don't want "Sure, I can help with that" bs, we just want the 5 questions and our additional formatting. Also it is 100% needed for the scoring
4. Skip pdf download for existing files (or probably some candidate indexing is needed)
5. Wait ummm, .docx for answer file? If needed I add `from docx import Document` in googlesheetfetcher
6. pipeline > AnswerPipeline > eval_func requires further dev

notes:
- point 1, following the documentation should be something like
```python
from gspread.utils import GridRangeType

list_of_lists = sheet.get(return_type=GridRangeType.ListOfLists)
responses = [dict(zip(list_of_lists[0], row)) for row in list_of_lists[1:]]
```

- So like, we can have the answer attachments responses saved to the same spreadsheet on a different worksheet. But we need to select by <worksheet name> instead of <worksheet number> (sheet1, sheet2, etc). Me already altered the sheet :3

- How to duplicate check for answer? CV/resume form use phone number, do we match by phone number too? Can we use email instead? (I think email is better)
